# NASA-Asteroids-Analysis-by-health
A project focused on analyzing and visualizing asteroid close approaches, velocities, and potential hazards using NASA's public data.This project provides analytical insights into Near-Earth Object (NEO) data collected from NASA, focusing on asteroids that closely approach Earth. The data is fetched from a MySQL database and visualized interactively using Streamlit.

## Project Features

- View full asteroid and close-approach data from a MySQL database.
- Perform 14+ interactive SQL-based analysis operations including:
  - Count how many times each asteroid approached Earth.
  - Identify fastest asteroids and calculate average velocity.
  - Detect potentially hazardous asteroids.
  - Find approaches closer than the Moon.
  - Month-wise and velocity-based filtering.
  - Closest approaches over time and brightness analysis.
